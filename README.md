# Introduction to Computer Programming - Assessed Assignment
## Encrypting a message with a Caesar Cipher

## Usage
Clone the repository
```ssh
git clone https://github.com/vandamd/ITP-Assignment.git
```

Install packages
- For pip users:
    ```ssh
    python -m pip install -U pip
    python -m pip install -U matplotlib
    ```
- For Anaconda users:
    ```ssh
    conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
    ```

Execute the program
```ssh
cd ITP-Assignment
python3 main.py
```

### Goals

After our introductory Python classes we were assigned to create an interactive Python program. The program would allow the user to:
- Input a message to be encrypted/decrypted using a Caesar cipher.
- Specify the rotation used by the Caesar cipher.
- Automate the identification of the rotation needed to decipher an encrypted message.
- Extract statistics about the messages, such as letter frequency, maximum word length, etc.

### Results
There were 60 marks available and I received 51.50 marks.
